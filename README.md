# UndErNsembled:

## About the model:

In this project, we reduced an imbalanced dataset (Undersampling) by <b>Consensus Clustering</b> using <b> 'Simple Majority Voting'</b> consensus function and further saw the increase in the accuracy of disease prediction by running multiple classifers with bagging and boosting technique.

## Dataset:

The dataset we have is the colon cancer dataset of <i>(62x2000)</i> dimension.

## Result:

This is the final result, i.e. comparison of different classifiers of predicting the disease accurately in both balanced and imbalanced data.
